# Screen reader guide

> Because great features should be accessible for everyone

`react-beautiful-dnd` ships with great screen reader support, in English, out of the box. If you just want to get started, then there's nothing you have to do. But if it's tailored messaging you're after, you have total control of that too.

This guide is here to help you create messaging that supports and delights your users. The screen reader experience is focused on keyboard interactions, but it's possible for a screen reader user to use any input type (for example mouse and keyboard).

## Tone

In the default messages we went for a friendly tone, choosing phrases such as "You have dropped the item" over "Item dropped". We know it's wordier, but we think the pronoun makes it personal and sound less like a computer.

Choose a tone that best supports what your audience is trying to do. If you need some inspiration and best practice guides, head to [https://atlassian.design](https://atlassian.design) and see how we communicate with our customers here at Atlassian.

## How to control announcements

The `announce` function is provided to each of the `DragDropContext > Hook` functions and can be used to deliver your own screen reader messages. Messages will be immediately read out. It's important to deliver messages immediately, so your users have a fast and responsive experience.

If you attempt to hold onto the `announce` function and call it later, it won't work and will just print a warning to the console. If you try to call announce twice for the same event, only the first will be read by the screen reader with subsequent calls to announce being ignored and a warning printed.

## Instructions to cover

### Step 1: Introduce draggable item

When a user `tabs` to a `Draggable`, we need to tell them how to start a drag. We do this by using the `aria-roledescription` property on a _drag handle_.

**Default message**: "Draggable item. Press space bar to lift"

We tell the user the following:

- The item is draggable
- How to start a drag

You don't need to give all the drag movement instructions at this point, let's wait until the user decides to start a drag.

Think about substituting the word "item" for a noun that matches your problem domain, for example, "task" or "issue". You might also want to drop the word "item" altogether.

### Step 2: Start drag

When a user lifts a `Draggable` by using the `spacebar` we want to tell them a number of things.

**Default message**: "You have lifted an item in position `${start.source.index + 1}`. Use the arrow keys to move, space bar to drop, and escape to cancel."

We tell the user the following:

- They have lifted the item
- What position the item is in
- How to move the item around

Notice that we don't tell them that they are in position `1 of x`. This is because we don't have access to the size of the list in the current api. It is like this for now to keep the api light and future proof as we move towards virtual lists. Feel free to add the the `1 of x` in your own messaging, and what list the item is in.

**Message with more info**: "You have lifted an item in position `${startPosition}` of `${listLength}` in the `${listName}` list. Use the arrow keys to move, space bar to drop, and escape to cancel."

You control the message printed to the user through the `DragDropContext` > `onDragStart` hook

```js
onDragStart = (start: DragStart, provided: HookProvided) => {
  provided.announce('My super cool message');
};
```

### Step 3: Drag movement

When a user has started a drag, there are different scenarios that can spring from that, so we'll create different messaging for each scenario.

We can control the announcement through the `DragDropContext` > `onDragUpdate` hook.

```js
onDragUpdate = (update: DragUpdate, provided: HookProvided) => {
  provided.announce('Update message');
};
```

#### Scenario 1. Moved in the same list

The user has moved backwards or forwards within the same list, so we want to tell the user what position they are now in.

**Default message**: "You have moved the item to position `${update.destination.index + 1}`".

Think about including of `${listLength}` in your messaging.

#### Scenario 2. Moved into a different list

The user has moved on the cross axis into a different list, so we want to tell them a number of things.

**Default message**: "You have moved the item from list `${update.source.droppableId}` in position `${update.source.index + 1}` to list `${update.destination.droppableId}` in position `${update.destination.index + 1}`".

We tell the user the following:

- They have moved to a new list
- Some information about the new list
- What position they have moved from
- What position they are now in

Think about using friendlier text for the name of the droppable, and including the length of the lists in the messaging.

**Message with more info**: "You have moved the item from list `${sourceName}` in position `${lastIndex}` of `${sourceLength}` to list `${destinationName}` in position `${newIndex}` of `${destinationLength}`".

#### Scenario 3. Moved over no list

You can't do this with a keyboard, but it's worthwhile having a message for this scenario, in case the user has a pointer for dragging.

**Default message**: "You are currently not dragging over a droppable area".

Think about how you could make this messaging friendlier and clearer.

### Step 4: On drop

There are two ways a drop can happen. Either the drag is cancelled or the user drops the dragging item. You can control the messaging for these events using the `DragDropContext > onDragEnd` hook.

#### Scenario 1. Drag cancelled

A `DropResult` object has a `reason` property which can either be `DROP` or `CANCEL`. You can use this to announce your cancel message.

```js
onDragEnd = (result: DropResult, provided: HookProvided) => {
  if (result.reason === 'CANCEL') {
    provided.announce('Your cancel message');
    return;
  }
};
```

**Default message**: "Movement cancelled. The item has returned to its starting position of ${result.source.index + 1}"

We tell the user the following:

- The drag has been cancelled
- Where the item has returned to

Think about adding information about the length of the list, and the name of the list you have dropped into.

**Message with more info**: "Movement cancelled. The item has returned to list `${listName}` to its starting position of `${startPosition}` of`${listLength}`".

#### Scenario 2. Dropped in the home list (in new position)

**Default message**: "You have dropped the item. It has moved from position `${result.source.index + 1}` to `${result.destination.index + 1}`"

We tell the user the following:

- They have completed the drag
- What position the item is in now

#### Scenario 3. Dropped in the home list (in original position)

**Default message**: "You have dropped the item. It has been dropped on its starting position of `${result.source.index + 1}`"

We tell the user the following:

- They have completed the drag
- That they dropped the item in the starting position
- The starting position

#### Scenario 4. Dropped on a foreign list

The messaging for this scenario should be similar to 'dropped in a home list', but we also add what list the item started in and where it finished.

**Default message**: "You have dropped the item. It has moved from position `${result.source.index + 1}` in list `${result.source.droppableId}` to position `${result.destination.index + 1}` in list `${result.destination.droppableId}`"

Think about including the name of the `Droppable`, instead of the ID. You might also want to include the position if your `Droppable`s are ordered.

#### Scenario 5. Dropped on no destination

You can't do this with a keyboard, but it's worthwhile having a message for this scenario, in case the user has a pointer for dragging.

**Default message**: "The item has been dropped while not over a droppable location. The item has returned to its starting position of ${result.source.index + 1}"

We tell the user the following:

- They dropped over a location that is not droppable
- Where the item has returned to

## That's all folks

We hope you find this guide useful. Feel free to send in suggestions for scenarios you'd like to see included, or you might want to share your own default messages and grow the knowledge even further ðŸ™‚.
