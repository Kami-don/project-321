## Feature request

This is not a general purpose drag and drop library and is attempting
to create an experience that is more physical than standard drag and drop
interactions on the web.

Before raising a new feature please ensure that it falls within the philosophy
of the library.

https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd#driving-philosophy-physicality

All features need to have a clear and generally applicable keyboard interaction pattern in order for us to deliver on our core goal of being highly accessible.

### Expected behavior

### Actual behavior

### Steps to reproduce

### What version of `React` are you using?

<!--
  Take a look at your package.json
  Ensure that it satifies our peer dependency version - see our package.json. (Currently it is "^16.3.1")
-->

### What version of `react-beautiful-dnd` are you running?

<!--
  We will only look into issues that are effecting the latest version.
  At this stage we are not releasing fixes for previous releases
-->

### What browser are you using?

<!--
Keep in mind our supported browser matrix https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/supported-browsers-744721663.html
If you raise a bug that is not in a supported version we will not be fixing it
-->

### Demo

<!--
Please provide an example to show the issue. Here is a boilerplate to help you get started:
https://codesandbox.io/s/k260nyxq9v

If you paste a big block of code it can be difficult to debug it.

If it is a visual bug, a video or a gif would be helpful also.

Issues without demo's may not be investigated

<!--
Note: stale issues will be removed
When a maintainer asks a question about an issue and it is not responded to within a reasonable time frame then the issue will be closed. We don't want this to happen - but we also do not want to accumulate stale issues
