Before raising a new feature please take a look at the core design
principles of the library:

https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd#driving-philosophy-physicality

This is not a general purpose drag and drop library and is attempting
to create an experience that is more physical than standard drag and drop
interactions on the web.

### Expected behavior

### Actual behavior

### Steps to reproduce

### Browser version

<!--
Keep in mind our supported browser matrix https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/supported-browsers-744721663.html
If you raise a bug that is not in a supported version we will not be fixing it
-->

### Demo

<!--
Please provide an example to show the issue. Here is a boilerplate to help you get started:
https://codesandbox.io/s/k260nyxq9v

If you paste a big block of code it can be difficult to debug it.

If it is a visual bug, a video or a gif would be helpful also.

Issues without demo's may not be investigated

<!--
Note: stale issues will be removed
When a maintainer asks a question about an issue and it is not responded to within a reasonable timeframe then the issue will be closed. We don't want this to happen - but we also do not want to accumulate stale issues
