### Expected behaviour

### Actual behaviour

### Steps to reproduce

### Browser version
<!-- 
Keep in mind our supported browser matrix https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/supported-browsers-744721663.html 
If you raise a bug that is not in a supported version we will not be fixing it
-->

### Demo
<!--
Please provide a webpack bin to show the issue. Here is a boilerplate to help you get started:
https://www.webpackbin.com/bins/-Kr9aE9jnUeWlphY8wsw

If you paste a big block of code it can be difficult to debug it.

If it is a visual bug, a video or a gif would be helpful also.

Issues without demo's may not be investigated

<!-- 
Note: stale issues will be removed
When a maintainer asks a question about an issue and it is not responded to within a reasonable timeframe then the issue will be closed. We don't want this to happen - but we also do not want to accumulate stale issues
